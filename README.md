# code-refactor

## Homework 1

Did my best to replace all div's with more descriptive tags, only repeating semantic tags when I deemed it necessary.
 * Mostly re-used figure, aside, and section with more specific tags as applicaple

CSS comments can be found directly on the style sheet detailing what specific rules acomplish
* Collapsed most of the glaringly repetative css rules into one another. 

Main outside resource consulted was W3 Schools Sematic HTML table found here : http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.pdf
